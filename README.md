# Memory-Game

This is a very simple game! All you need to do is remember the sequence of buttons pressed by the computer and replicate it.  
Every level the computer will press an additional button and you need to press all the previous buttons in the correct order AND the new button.  
  
Playing is the best way to learn!  

This idea is taken from "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.
